# CPCS324_PROJECT_PART2
Objective:

• Provide an opportunity to work with complex data structures 

• Develop advanced programming skills. 

Learning Outcomes:

• CLO #10: Design an algorithm/Pseudocode based on Greedy techniques for a computing problem.

“Air freight is a system of transporting goods which can be commercial or non-commercial by 
aircraft. … Aircraft can travel for a certain number of kilometers to deliver freight from one location to 
another. ... The problem, however, is an optimization problem to cut down the distances travelled 
minimizing the number of stops-over so as to optimize the time for delivery of time-sensitive goods and 
minimize the total cost “. [1] Implement the Dijkstra algorithm and develop an application that uses this 
algorithm to compute the shortest path between every pair of locations, so that an Air freight company can 
use it to speed up its delivery service and minimize fuel costs.
